# Kola - Language Learning Speaking Practice App

## Origin Story of Kola
So here's the thing - I was learning Chinese and kept running into this annoying problem. You know how it goes - you learn all these characters, memorize the grammar, but when it comes to actually speaking? That's where things get messy.
I had classmates who spoke Chinese, sure. But let's be real - nobody wants to be that person who's constantly bugging their friends to practice the same basic phrases over and over. Especially when your tones are nto right and your level is not the best. You end up holding back, practicing less, and feeling stuck (while practicing speaking is the best way to learn a new language for me!!).
Then one day, OpenAI drops this real-time voice feature and i thought- What if I could create an AI language buddy? Something that wouldn't judge my horrible pronunciation, wouldn't get tired of my hundredth attempt at saying "你好", and would be there whenever I felt like practicing?
That's how Kola was born. 

Originally wanted to call it Koala (because Koala are cute), but then dropped the 'a' to make it snappier. Plus, it kinda sounds like "cola" - hopefully it'll be just as refreshing for other language learners stuck in the same boat.
## Core Concept
Kola (derived from "Koala") is a language learning app focused on speaking practice, leveraging AI for conversation practice in a judgment-free environment.

## Technical Requirements

### Permissions
- Internet access
- Microphone recording
- Storage (for audio caching) 

### Core Technologies
- Firebase (Authentication, Database)
- Dependency Injection
- Audio Recording/Playback
- OpenAI Voice API Integration

### Architecture Considerations
- Clean Architecture principles (i tried to add comments wherever need, made the name of the variables explicit, )
- Used the ModelView-Screen pattern
-

## Development Priorities
1. Core speaking functionality
2. User authentication
3. Progress tracking
